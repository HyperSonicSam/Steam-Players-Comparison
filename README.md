# Steam-Players-Comparison
 This project analyzes the Steam Country Dataset, comparing player numbers and XP by country. After cleaning and refining the data, three regression models (Linear, L1, L2) predict XP based on playtime. Key steps include removing unnecessary data, identifying the main ranking factor (Points), and normalizing data. Regression results show high linearity and accuracy (R² ≈ 0.99).
